# disease-prediction-model
Using supervised learning techniques and a labeled dataset. Calculated correlation and covariance of variables to determine significant ones in prediction of heart disease occurrence. Using different ML methods, compared the combined prediction accuracies of all methods to determine the best method for heart disease prediction.
